Email reminders and rescheduling for GP appointments.

## Brief

More than 15 million GP appointments are missed annually, costing the NHS hundreds of millions of pounds. Your task is to build a proactive, ethical appointments assistant for a GP surgery that will call or email remind the patients prior to their appointments to confirm date and time, and increase the likelihood the patient will attend. There should be a good conversational flow, with the assistant leading the conversation, and learning over time how to handle conversations more effectively and even become personalised based on patients’ input. Extra features include handling prescription renewal, and appointment booking by phone or email.
